subtitle: Conserving the Fresh Water Pearl Mussel

Through my with Alba Ecology, I have been working on a large number of voluntary activities, under the title of ‘Mollusc of the Glen’ to help conserve the globally endangered freshwater pearl mussel (_Margetifera Margetifera_). This work has focused on three main areas:

- Undertake and publish important new scientific research into the species, including discoveries of global conservation importance.

- Raise awareness of the key threats posed to the species.

- Engage with a wide range of stakeholders to help protect and conserve this fantastic species.

 ## Conservation outcomes

Alba Ecology’s Donald Shields and Cameron Cosgrove undertook these and discovered a brand new pearl mussel population for science in a small, remote and previously unsurveyed north of Scotland watercourse.

In 2013 we discovered and surveyed a hugely important population of freshwater pearl mussel. This unexploited and undescribed population is now recognised as the most important freshwater pearl mussel population in Scotland and the UK. It is the only such population known to science and is a suitable benchmark/reference site for European conservation work. Historically, many Scottish pearl mussel rivers would have held mussels in the densities found in this unexploited site. We worked with the surrounding local community to support the conservation of this site.

## Recognition 
Mollusc of the Glen recived the [Nature of Scotland Award](https://www.rspb.org.uk/about-the-rspb/at-home-and-abroad/scotland/nature-of-scotland-awards/winners-and-finalists/2014/) in 2014 for championing freshwater pearl mussels.
