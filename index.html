<h1>About</h1>

<img src="/img/prof_square.jpg" width=250 style="float:right">
<p>I am an early career ecologist who wants to make impactful contributions to global conservation efforts.  I work at the interface of data driven science and real-world management. My strong quantitative skill set allows me to inform smart conservation decision making, improving the effectiveness of conservation efforts. I am a very capable field worker, with significant experience in extreme and remote locations. My current research interest revolves around how conservationists can utilise Google Earth Engine (an open source remote sensing platform) to gauge and respond to species specific environmental threats.</p>
