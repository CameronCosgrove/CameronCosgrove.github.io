							<p>EVALUATING FOREST LOSS IN RED PANDA (AILURUS FULGENS) HABITAT BETWEEN 2000 & 2018</p>

								<h3>Findings</h3>
								<p>Habitat loss has consistently been identified as the largest threat facing the endangered red panda (Ailurus fulgens). Deforestation is driving red panda habitat loss and has contributed to the species rapid decline, yet the state of red panda habitat is unknown across its entire range. This gap in knowledge is a barrier for effective conservation of panda populations. Using the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset, this dissertation quantifies the extent of forest loss across the red panda habitat, and maps the areas of low and high forest disturbance. My results show that 1753 km2 (>1.3%) of forest has been lost between 2000-2018, with roughly equal amounts of forest being lost each year. Hotspots of forest loss were identified in India, Burma, and China, with lower elevations more likely to lose forest than higher elevations. The forest network in red panda habitat appears connected in each sub population; however, two narrow forest corridors showed substantial deforestation. These results suggest that the red panda is at risk of further reproductive isolation due to the loss of critical forest corridors. Conservation action should be targeted at maintaining high elevation forest corridors, ensuring red panda populations maintain genetic viability. This dissertation highlights that a range wide view of red panda populations is needed to inform effective conservation decision making. In addition to localised ground based surveys, remote sensing tools such as GFC should be used to monitor the condition of red panda habitat over large areas.</p>

Each point on the map represents the average forest loss within the surrounding 1 km2 circular area.
